                    <p class="description-of-image"> You were one big eater, weren't you? To the point that you'd even eat weird stuff like a worm-shaped candy or you might've been
                        the type to suck on candy that tasted and looked like lipstick... You did you, no judges there... Anyway, as a child, you'd been exposed to various Filipino
                        delicacies like Turon, BananaQ, Sapin-sapin, Kutsinta, Bola-bola, etc. and these were one of the things you'd usually eat as your merienda. And they're probably still
                        being devoured by you to this day with how delicious, tasty, and fulfilling they are...

                    <p class="description-of-image"> When we talk about food during childhood, how could we not remember the merienda that our mothers used to prepare for us in the afternoon?
                         Or perhaps the food we buy from the street vendors that pass our homes? Merienda has been a big part of our life growing up since most of the time we sit, eat, and 
                         talk to not just our family, but our friends too while eating indoors or outdoors...

                    <p class="description-of-image"> A special thank you to Ms. Rji Anne Jonette Villaflor for thinking of creating an art relevant to food, specially merienda as this makes you
                        crave for one right now, doesn't it? She used an illustration board, colored pencils, a pencil, and a drawing pen to apply the techniques of Sketch, Heavy pressure, Back & Forth stroke,
                        and Scrumbling, and allowing this cute piece of art to be viewed by our eyes, with it serving as their merienda.
