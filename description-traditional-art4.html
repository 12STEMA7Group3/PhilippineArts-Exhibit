                        and company. In times of sorrow and agony, I will be with you and give you warmth and a shoulder you can cry on. In times of loneliness, I will give you happiness
                        and love. In moments of rebellion, I will be here, waiting for the day that you'd realize just how much I treasure, love, and adore you. You are my precious child and always
                        will be. I love you... "

                        Thank you for the love, care, and guidance you've given me. Because of this, I was able to become the person that I am today. You are my gardener, my nurturer, and I hope that you will
                        still be alive when I become successful. I will show you the most beautiful of things in the whole wide world and make you feel young again. I love you too, mother..."

                    <p class="description-of-image"> In the Filipino language, Kalinga means protecting and caring for someone. A Filipino mother and a child are both represented in this work of art as they
                        display affection and protectiveness toward each other. Seeing this artwork might remind you of the times when they would wait patiently for you to come home and took care of you through
                        physical touch and verbal and emotional affirmation.

                        to remind us the beatiful love a mother has for their child. A heartwarming experience and dynamic to ever feel in this world full of flaws and cruelty. She used the techniques that are used in making a paper mache.
