                        to go outside and play with your friends joyously. All you ever focused on was wanting to find that one sneaky 
                        child in your hide-and-seek game, or that athletic and annoying kid whose movements were so swift that you wouldn't be able to
                        tag him/her even when he/she stood in his/her place for awhile. It was frustrating, wasn't it? And although it felt like that, 
                        these emotions still put a smile on your face as you think back to those sweet, happy memories...

                    <p class="description-of-image"> Reminiscence allows you to remember the good ol' days, and this artwork does just that. The moments way back during your childhood where you could still do everything freely, 
                        play outside as if there was no problem, play the famous childhood games “sungka”, “jolens”, “luksong lubid”, and also the popular toy of all time, the “trumpo” 
                        that was used mostly by boys. Those were the things that remain only as a fragment of your past, the happiest parts of your life that will linger within you and everyone else --- Forever...

                    <p class="description-of-image"> A rainfall of gratitude for Ms. Vanessa Kayla Vallejos for sharing with us her skills in making digital artworks as she brought forth this nostalgic
                        piece of art where a girl can be seen looking at her past and the window symbolizes her mind. She used a cellphone and a software called "IbisPaint X" with the technique
                        of Digital Painting.
