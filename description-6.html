                        quite annoying, weren't they? Oh, were you one of them? Sorry... However, you may have also been like one of these kids in the photo whom caught the attention of Ms. Lea
                        Joy Salcedo since they were looking at her. If you were, then you were probably as sweet as them...

                    <p class="description-of-image"> These are the thoughts of the photographer, Ms. Lea Joy Salcedo, before and during the time she took this picture: “I got used to the fact that 
                        there are always children playing in front of our house but the moment I took this picture, two adorable little neighbor girls were just watching me key unlock the 
                        door as I got home from school on November 23, 2022. They caught my eye for their matching purple headbands, and cute dresses, and we chatted for a bit, asked their names, 
                        how old they were, and what color they liked. I was lifted up by the chit-chat we had, recalling how I used to think the world was just about playing, colors, 
                        laughter, offering undivided attention, and learning something new from every new experience...”

                    <p class="description-of-image"> It is of utmost necessity to offer gratitude to fate as it allowed
                        Ms. Lea Joy Salcedo to experience the warmth youth can bring and because of this, it allowed her to bring 
                        this heartwarming image of two children who we may or may not see again. Such a rare occurence, this is! 
                        A thank you to Ms. Salcedo for using a camera phone and a VSCO app and allowed us to have a bit of what you have experienced
                        when she met these precious kids. The techniques she used to create this masterpiece are: Simplification, Repitition, Pattern...
