                    <p class="description-of-image">  You might be a 90's kid if you resonate with this art style. They used to utilize this style in television and 
                        cartoons, right? Oh, it was definitely the best time to be born in if you wanted to fully experience the outdoor and carefree life of
                        being a young Filipino child who would always go home dirty and smelling like Sinigang or the sun.

                <div class="paragraph-text-descriptions">
                    <p class="description-of-image"> Since then, graffiti artworks could be seen all over the Philippines, which were particularly scattered around the walls of different kinds of infrastructure. 
                        For some, it was considered vandalism, and the government concurred with this issue, so they usually repaint the walls. However, painting over visible graffiti artwork on walls 
                        didn't change the fact that it was there in the first place. This was similar to how vintage toys were made; there were constant innovations in creating new concepts as the 
                        years passed. From generation to generation, there were new trends when it comes to what stuff a kid should be playing. 
                        However, for some reason, classic toys such as sipa, yo-yo, plastic balloons, and so on became memorable to Filipinos and became a significant part of Filipino culture.

                    <p class="description-of-image"> A special thanks to Mr. Franco Inyigo Ramos for doing his best in creating this unforgettable art style. He used an illustration board, colored pencils, a pencil, and Acrylic paint to
                        bring this beautiful piece of art to life, along with the techniques called Sketch, Heavy pressure, and Back & Forth stroke.
